             The Department of Biochemistry at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore started in 1921. It has remained in the forefront
			 of biochemical research in the country. It has deservedly received recognition at various stages of its growth. The department was recognized as a Centre of Advanced study in Biochemistry in 1968 by the University Grants Commission. This Department has continuously provided 
			 the nucleus that has led to the establishment of new centres of focused research within the Institute, and also research institutions elsewhere such as the Lac Research Institute (Ranchi), 
			 Central Food Technological Research Institute (Mysore) and ASTRA Research Centre (Bangalore).

           The Inorganic and Physical Chemistry (IPC) department is one of the most prestigious departments at the Indian Institute of Science and is devoted to advanced research and teaching in chemistry. Since its inception in 1909, the department has distinguished
		   itself as a Centre for innovative and pioneering research in a wide range of areas in inorganic and physical chemistry. It was elevated to the status of a UGC Centre of Advanced Study in 1980 in recognition to its achievements in these fields and recently to the status of DST-FIST Sponsored Department. The major research efforts are focussed on such areas as molecular structure and dynamics, laser spectroscopy, organometallic and coordination chemistry,
		   bioinorganic and biomimetic chemistry, energy systems, catalysis, polymers and electrochemistry.

          The department of Aeronautical Engineering was started in December 1942. Thus, after the department of Electrical Technology, 
		  the Department of Aeronautical Engineering is the oldest engineering department at the Institute. The services of Dr. V.M. Ghatage, one of the few trained aeronautical engineers in the country at that time and who was working in HAL, were lent to the Institute during 1942-1947. He was the head of the department till 1945. During 1945-48, Dr. R.G. Harris of the Royal Aircraft Establishment U.K. was professor and Head of the Department. Prof. O.G. Tietjens was appointed as the Head of the department in 1949 and continued till 1954. After 1955, induction of foreigners to head, 
		  the department was discontinued and one of the professors acted as Head or Chairman of the department.

           In the recent years, with new centres such as CiSTUP (The Centre of Infrastructure, Sustainable Transportation, and Urban Planning), the Divecha Centre for Climate Change, the Centre for Earth Sciences, the Centre for NeuroScience, the Centre for Excellence in Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE), and the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems (RBCCPS), the Institute has vigorously promoted inter-disciplinary research. Indeed, CiSTUP, RBCCPS and a new Centre for Brain Research (funded by a large private endowment) are expected to conduct
		   translational research in their respective areas, in order to better connect with industry and society.

The Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) was established in 2010 to pursue interdisciplinary research across several disciplines with a focus on nanoscale systems. Current research topics include, but are not limited to nanoelectronics, MEMS/NEMS, nanomaterials and devices, photonics, nano-biotechnology, solar cells and computational nano-engineering. Apart from the regular faculty members at CeNSE, almost 40 faculty members from different departments at IISc are associated in the academic and research activities at the centre. The centre offers PhD programs in a wide range of areas, and has close interactions with the industry. A state-of-the art nanofabrication facility with a clean room spanning 1400 square meters is located at the centre. In addition, there are several characterization 
labs that cater to material, electronic, mechanical, chemical and optical characterization.

           The Department of Physics was established in the year 1933 by Prof. Sir C.V. Raman. It soon evolved into an advanced centre for research with outstanding work in optics and spectroscopy.

Several illustrious names of Indian Science such as Homi Bhabha, Vikram Sarabhai, R.S.Krishnan, G.N.Ramachandran and S.Ramaseshan have been associated with this department.

The department has continued this tradition of excellence and has now become an internationally recognised centre for research in condensed matter physics and physics of biomolecules. The department also co-ordinates an interinstitutional programme in Astronomy and Astrophysics.

Many of the faculty members have received national and international recognition and several occupy high positions in national scientific institutions.
